            By the end of the eighteenth century, Teknaf was in dire need of potable water. There was only one 
            fresh water well in the police station premises which is the only one in the whole of Teknaf. 
            Every day Rakhine young women used to come to fetch water from the well.

            Dhiraj Bhattacharya was transferred here from Calcutta. Mathin, the daughter of a Rakhine zamindar, used to 
            come with other Rakhine girls to fetch water. In this way, Mathinâ€™s love affair with Dhiraj started. The two 
            also decided to get married. But suddenly a letter from Calcutta informs Dhiraj that his father is seriously ill.
            As a result, Dhiraj prepared to return to Calcutta. But Mathin did not agree. Her idea was that once the 
            foreigner left, he would never return. So Dhiraj left for Calcutta without informing Mathin. Mathin suffered 
            a lot and gave up eating and drinking. In no way could she be understood. At one point, Mathin fell to his death.
